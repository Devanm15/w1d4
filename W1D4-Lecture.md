#W1D4 Lecture

make an object with arrays and objects nested inside,

object index can be anything, an array will always have an index of integer

-   primitive values only

if the result returns false inside of the for loop it will negate the loop because it will only run through the first part of the function
accessing the keys that are elements in the array access by index (not directly).

if the functin variable is not defined it will attempt to read the variables as undefined

adding extra variables the code will just omit the extra values

functions can be passed in as variable argument

-   functions assigned as variables and then called in the function later,

anonymous functions - functions can be assigned in function that it is being used in if the function is being defined by the same number of arguments

the name is only relavent to the action of the function

x^2 + y^2 = value = 2 sqr.root
